# ReasonTabQA: A Benchmark for Table Question Answering from Real-World Industrial Scenarios

This repository serves as a temporary demonstration for the ReasonTabQA benchmark.

The ReasonTabQA_samples.zip directory contains sample tables from our benchmark, including 4 industrially relevant types (single tables, multiple tables, complex structured tables, and extremely large-scale tables). These examples represent the challenging nature of table structures encountered in practical applications. The ReasonTabQA dataset will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Additionally, the tabcoderl_trainer.yamlfile demonstrates key parameter configurations for reinforcement learning training within TabCodeRL, showcasing practical setup for model adaptation and evaluation.

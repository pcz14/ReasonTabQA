# ReasonTabQA: A Benchmark for Table Question Answering from Real-World Industrial Scenarios

This repository serves as a temporary demonstration for the ReasonTabQA benchmark.

The data/ directory contains sample tables from our benchmark, showcasing the diversity and complexity of industrial-grade tabular data used in our evaluation. These examples represent the challenging nature of table structures encountered in practical applications. The ReasonTabQA dataset will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.
